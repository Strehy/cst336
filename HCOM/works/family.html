                <p>A Family Thing is a film that brings two sides of a family together in an unconventional way. Earl Pilcher is a white southerner who was born a raised in a small town in Arkansas. 
                His brother Raymond is a police officer in Chicago who has grown up seeing the effects of discrimination. While both men were born to the same mother, they grew up in completely different circumstances and developed different cultural identities because of it. 
                Pilcher formed biases from what he saw in the environment around him. His town had a culture that is deeply rooted in southern traditions of racism. Pilcher brought these biases with him on his journey to Chicago. When Earl and Raymond end up in a wrestling match, the fight ends with Earl calling Raymond the n-word.
                His troubles continue when he gets drunk in a bar and pesters a black couple which end in him being thrown out and sleeping on the street for the night. This incident allows Earl to begin a journey of reflection. Through his continued interactions with his new family he is able to overcome the biases he learned throughout his childhood. 
                This culminates in the movies ending where both brothers reconcile over their mother's grave. Earl is able to overcome his bias and even invites Raymond to meet his side of the family. This movie shows us how we can overcome a bias instilled in us from our culture and learn to accept one another.</p>
