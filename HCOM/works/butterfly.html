                <p>M. Butterfly is a play about a blind love between Rene Gillard and Liling Song. The play focuses on a romanticized view of the oriental from Gillard. After watching the play Madame Butterfly, Gillard begins to fantasize about falling in love with an eastern woman. When Gillard exclaims, “It’s true what they say about Oriental girls. 
                They want to be treated bad!”, he is showing his blind view on eastern culture. Gillard saw these women as more subservient and docile than the western women in which he had found no luck in finding love.</p> 
                
                <p>Gillard’s romanization was a naive way to generalize an entire culture. . He wanted his view of the oriental to be true so badly to the point that it blinded him to truth that Song was a man and was using him. 
                In the end of the film Gillard is left heartbroken and hopeless; not wanting to live in reality. When he performs seppuku, it is his final way of trying to bring the eastern culture he adored into his life.</p>
