                <p>I shall not be moved was a series of poems from the poet Maya Angelou. Angelou draws upon her heritage as well as discrimination that she faced in order to write her poetry. 
                Throughout her works she dives head first into issues that have haunted the African American community. The poem “Our Grandmothers” is a powerful piece that explores a history of families being torn apart. 
                In this poem she describes vile acts such as lynching and the sale of family members. She repeats the line, “I shall not be Moved” many times throughout the poem. This is a message of strength and unity, and a stand to continually move forward. The poem “Televised” is another poem in which Angelou calls on her culture. 
                She describes children starving and losing hope against a system that is working against them. She tells us that we are wasting half our lives in front of the television, instead of making changes. Angelou’s cultural ties allowed for her to draw strength and to spread it to others.</p>
