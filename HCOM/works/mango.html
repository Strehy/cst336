                <p>The House on Mango Street is a highly influential novel and a coming of age story. The novel shows how the main character, Esperanza Cordero, is influenced by her heritage and culture. Esperanza struggles to find her place in a predominately white community.
                In the chapter “Those who don’t”, the protagonist talks about how whites who come onto mango street feel about the Latino people living there. She talks about how they are scared of them for their darker skin and how they believe that they are all criminals. 
                Esperanza describes the situation by saying, “In the meantime they'll just have to move a little farther north from Mango Street, a little farther away every time people like us keep moving in.” She wasn’t seen for the person that she is, but rather just a skin tone. </p> 
                
                <p>Esperanza had to deal with many hardships during her time on mango street. She wanted to escape the hardships and discrimination that faced every day. Esperanza escape of mango street also freed her from the shackles of abuse based on heritage.
                Her vow to return and to help those still left on mango street is a promise to reform the culture to empower the Latino community.</p>
