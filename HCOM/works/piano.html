                <p>The piano lesson is a play, written by August Wilson, about an African American family in Pittsburg in the years following the great depression. The Charles family has owned a special piano with their family history carved into the side for generations. 
                The main conflict is between two members of the family Boy Willie and Bernice. Boy Wille wants to sell the piano so that he can buy land while Bernice wants to keep the piano due to its importance to their heritage. The piano comes from the Sutters family who owned the Charles family during slavery.
                Bernice described her mother taking care if the piano in the quote “polished this piano with her tears for seventeen years. For seventeen years she rubbed on it till her hands bled. Then she rubbed the blood in, mixed it up with the rest.” The piano took in the very heart and soul of the Charles family and shows history of pain they endured.</p> 
                
                <p>The piano lessons are a connection to your family's past. The Charles family, like many other African American families, had to reinvent a culture that they lost after enduring years of slavery. The piano is a piece of new culture that the Charles family is able to cherish.
                The Charles family teaches us to come to terms with were we come from, and to look forward to see what you can do with it.</p>
