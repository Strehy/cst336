                <p>In today's busy world we often forget to stop and remember where we come from. Our past can be defined by our heritage and the culture it brings with it.
                Culture can be defined as the customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group. By stopping and reflecting on our culture we can see the impact it has on the world around us.</p> 
                
                <p>Culture is often a focal point for many works of art. Literature and film use culture as a way to express a narrative and to show others a piece of their past.
                This site will explore how culture has been used to influence works by American writers and film makers.</p>
